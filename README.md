I just completed this virtual experience program by *ANZ Banking*.Also, i applied some exploratory data functions such as *glimpse* and **summarise** in my dataset.
Firstly, i run some diagnostics to find if the dataset has any NA's values or outliers.
After that with ggplot2 i analyzed any potential relationships in my variables(both numeric and categorical). Next i wanted to find if there were any correlations in my numeric variables preferrably with the pearson method
